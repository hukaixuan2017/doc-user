The two-factor token will be sent to the email address of the agent.

Selecting the *Enable email secority* option activates an opportunistic encryption of the sent email containing the two-factor token. This feature will work only if either PGP or S/MIME subsystem is activated, and there is a public key or certificate available for the agentâ€™s target email address. Otherwise the email will be sent in plain text.
